# Malware Detection-CNN
Implementation and result comparison of multiple Convolutional Neural Network Architectures on the MalIMG and MaleVIS datasets.

# Dive into the Project
This project contains many sections, Here's an overview of each section:
* Comparaison between four different models presented in recent research papers, in order to study their behavior and choose the model with the lowest performance and work ob optimizing it
* Choosing to apply some specific modification into the chosen model, and study how it will affect the performance of the model.
* Creating a combinations of these modifications in order to find the optimal model for detecting malwares
* All these models were applied to MalIMG dataset.
* This project also investigated the effect of these models on The Malevis Dataset, which led to a challenge of overfitting, which will be taken into consideration as futur work.
